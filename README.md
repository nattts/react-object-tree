# Getting Started 

In the project directory, you can run:

##### `git clone https://github.com/nattts/react-object-tree.git`
##### `npm install`
##### `npm start`

##### Please make sure the responseData.json is placed in the src forlder.

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


#### Summary: 

Considering the time limitations I have focused on the main functionality that was requested to deliver in the task description. Below is the list of things that to my opinion could be improved:

- overall CSS. Especially popup modal for user input. could definitely use ajdustments especially in terms of responsiveness 
- form fields validation. Check if input is in the right format (upper/lowercase case | allowed symols) 
- service to check if JSON file is present and available to be read from and send the appropriate error message. At the moment the app goes down if can't read from the responseData.json.
